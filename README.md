*A short video how does it look like in real time.*

HideMyIcon is an Autohotkey script to auto-hide the desktop icons in Windows 10. It also offers a customizable fading effect.

When I use multi-monitor setups I get easily annoyed by the icons by just seeing them from my peripheral view.

This simple script helps me to control the visibility of the icons in Windows 10+.

- 17.01.2023 - update to v0.4, AHK v2 support, standalone function without GUI (this version should work on Windows 11)
